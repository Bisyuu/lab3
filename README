Question B:

size = 1000
sort():0.001 seconds
v1/v2 are different
insertion_sort():0.009 seconds
v1/v2 are the same

size = 10000
sort():0.004 seconds
v1/v2 are different
insertion_sort():0.971 seconds
v1/v2 are the same

size = 100000
sort():0.048 seconds
v1/v2 are different
insertion_sort():96.027 seconds
v1/v2 are the same

size = 1000000
sort():0.448 seconds
v1/v2 are different
insertion_sort():9842.025 seconds
v1/v2 are the same


At first,the time sort() and insertion_sort() cost are almost the same.
As the size increases,the time insertion_sort() costs rises extremely.
